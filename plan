order by priority, except the first one

[] test all below functionalities using seperate machines!

[] connection management
	[x] when guest joins a room entry, it trys to establish a TCP connection to the host
	[x] once connected
		[x] guest start sending periodical heartbeat(through the TCP connection) to host to indicate its signal strength
		[x] host updates guest signal strength with their heartbeat packets
		[x] host send guest list to the newly connected guest so they can initialize their room UI
	[x] in the room
		[x] when host finds a new guest has joined the room, it tells all guests(through the TCP connection) about it so they can update their room UI
		[x] when a guest exits the room, it tells the host(TCP), then disconnect
		[x] when host finds a guest has exited, it tells all guests(TCP) about it so they can update their room UI
		[x] when host exit(thus dismiss) the room, notify all guests to return to lobby

[] game session management
	[] host clicks start game...
		[] send game starting packet to all guests
		[] all players(host&guest) exec game with cmd args, which are other players' ip addr
		[] show a 'Game running..' screen and disable all inputs until the game is finished(process end)
	[] when game ends...

[] maybe try to write tests for this project

[] coalesce all periodical work into one single thread

[] stop all threads gracefully so there is no weird error message when program quits

[x] lobby screen to show all discovered rooms

[x] click a room to join it

[x] room screen shows all connected guests

[x] remove linux proprietary headers, to compile it on windows

[x] tell room name to guests with the broadcast message
	[x] show received room name

[x] refactor lan with SFML network lib

[x] button class

[x] list view class, maybe a widget lib

[x] replace all render() into draw(), aka sf::Drawable
